### ðŸ’¬ About
I'm a software craftsman building scalable web applications with Javascript/Typescript, Python, and PHP. 

I contribute to [open source projects](#open-source-projects-i'm-actively-contributing-to) I find interesting and write about my learning on <a href="https://hashnode.com/@devteni">hashnode</a>. As an advocate for simplicity, I practice the art of explaining technical and seemingly abstract concepts in software engineering and computer science regularly.


### :construction: What I'm Currently Working On
- [BigFastAPI](https://github.com/bigfastcode/bigfastapi) (A supercharged version of [FastAPI](fastapi.tiangolo.com) that takes away the hard stuff in building backend APIs)

### :book: What I'm Actively Learning.
- Database engineering
- Algorithm design
- User Experience(UX)

###  ðŸ“« Collaboration? 
I'm open to paid collaborations on API documentation and contract gigs on technical writing and software development.

### Reach Out
I'm open to learning new stuff in the intersection of culture and technology too.
