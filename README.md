#### ðŸ’¬ About
âœ¨ I am software engineer currently building scalable web applications with Javascript/Typescript, Python, and PHP. I use React to build user interfaces on the frontend a number of familiar technologies on the backend. I contribute to [open source projects](#open-source-projects-i'm-actively-contributing-to) I find interesting and write about my learning on <a href="https://hashnode.com/@devteni">hashnode</a>. As an advocate for simplicity, I'm currently learning to master the art of explaining the seemingly abstract concepts in tech and computer science in general in black and white.

Outside tech - I read books, play chess, ... A big fan of Rap too :)

### Open source Projects I'm actively contributing to.
- [BigFastAPI](https://github.com/bigfastcode/bigfastapi) (A supercharged version of FastAPI that takes away the hard stuff in building backend APIs)
