Teniola Fatunmbi - Just vibes actually.
As vibes goes, I'm currently building something really fun with a couple of folks at HNG as an intern Software engineer. When I want to build user interfaces on the web, I use React, although I'm a bigger fan of JavaScript on the backend(Nodejs). I contribute to open source projects I find interesting and write about my learning on hashnode. As an advocate for simplicity, I'm currently learning to master the art of explaining the seemingly abstract concepts in tech and computer science in general in black and white.

Outside tech - I read books, play chess
