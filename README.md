### ğŸ’¬ About
I build software products with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and PHP. I'm currently doing the best work I can at a couple of places. 

As an advocate for simplicity, I enjoy the art of explaining technical and seemingly abstract concepts with the visceral expression of my thoughts on paper.


### Interests:
- User Experience(UX).
- Software architecture.
- Backend engineering.
- Local-first development.

### Reach Out
I'm open to learning new stuff at the intersection of culture and technology.
