### ğŸ’¬ About
I'm a software engineer with production-level experience in building scalable web applications with Javascript/Typescript, Python, and PHP. I'm currently doing the best work I can at a couple of places. 

As an advocate for simplicity, I enjoy the art of explaining technical and seemingly abstract concepts in the visceral expression of my thoughts on paper.


### :book: I'm always learning:
- Empathic UI development.
- User Experience(UX).
- Software architecture.

###  ğŸ“« Collaboration? 
I'm open to paid collaborations on API documentation and contract gigs on technical writing and software development.

### Reach Out
I'm open to learning new stuff at the intersection of culture and technology.
