### ðŸ’¬ About
âœ¨ I am software engineer currently building scalable web applications with Javascript/Typescript, Python, and PHP. I use ReactJS to build user interfaces for the web and a number of familiar server-side technologies for backend development. I contribute to [open source projects](#open-source-projects-i'm-actively-contributing-to) I find interesting and write about my learning on <a href="https://hashnode.com/@devteni">hashnode</a>. As an advocate for simplicity, I'm currently learning to master the art of explaining the seemingly abstract concepts in tech and computer science in general in black and white.

Outside tech - I read books, play chess sometimes, ... A big fan of Rap too :)
