#### ðŸ’¬ About
âœ¨ I am software engineer currently building something really fun at <a href="hng.tech">HNG</a>. I use React to build user interfaces on the frontend and Nodejs(which I'm more inclined to) on the backend. I contribute to open source projects I find interesting and write about my learning on <a href="https://hashnode.com/@devteni">hashnode</a>. As an advocate for simplicity, I'm currently learning to master the art of explaining the seemingly abstract concepts in tech and computer science in general in black and white.

Outside tech - I read books, play chess, ... A big fan of Rap too ðŸ™‚.

- ðŸ“« Collaboration? If you text we could be friends
